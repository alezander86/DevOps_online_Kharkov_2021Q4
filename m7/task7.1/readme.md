** A. Create a script that uses the following keys:

** 1. When starting without parameters, it will display a list of possible keys and their description. 

* ![](screen/Screenshot_1.png)

** 2. The --all key displays the IP addresses and symbolic names of all hosts in the current subnet.

* ![](screen/Screenshot_2.png)

** 3. The --target key displays a list of open system TCP ports.

** The code that performs the functionality of each of the subtasks must be placed in a separate function

** B. Using Apache log example create a script to answer the following questions:

** 1. From which ip were the most requests?

* ![](screen/Screenshot_4.png)

** 2. What is the most requested page? 

* ![](screen/Screenshot_5.png)

** 3. How many requests were there from each ip? 

* ![](screen/Screenshot_6.png)

** 4. What non-existent pages were clients referred to?  

* ![](screen/Screenshot_7.png)

** 5. What time did site get the most requests? 

* ![](screen/Screenshot_8.png)

** 6. What search bots have accessed the site? (UA + IP)

** C. Create a data backup script that takes the following data as parameters:

** 1. Path to the syncing  directory.
** 2. The path to the directory where the copies of the files will be stored.

* ![](screen/Screenshot_11.png)

* ![](screen/Screenshot_12.png)

In case of adding new or deleting old files, the script must add a corresponding entry to the log file indicating the time, type of operation and file name. [The command to run the script must be added to crontab with a run frequency of one minute]
